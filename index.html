        <h1>Navigating this journey has raised many questions about my future outlooks. 
            I am certain I want to move into the film and entertainment industry; whether that
            be in the production or post-production sectors. However, I have chosen the route 
            of trying to be the jack of all trades digitally (video editing, coding for interaction,
            animation, 3D environments). As you may know, this semester I focused on gaining a solid 
            understanding of all things code. Despite this, I have yet to be a master of one.</h1>

            make my second move towards what I want to focus on and truly master for a lifetime.</h1>
