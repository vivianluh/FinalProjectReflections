            <p> A hint fiction interactive build that leaves audiences wanting more 
                about the fate of a city whose prosperity is dependent on the perpetual 
                misery of a child, directly based on the short story 'The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas' 
                by Ursula K. Le Guin.  </p>

            <h1>Hint Fiction: For the City of Joy to keep its joy, in a basement, away from 
                the sunlight a child must lie alone, naked, sore, and beat. </h1>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p>In 'The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas', K. Le Guin deliberately utilises 
                both extremely vague and vivid descriptions to invite readers to immerse 
                themselves into the story and form their own decisions when handling the 
                same situation (a pragmatic sacrifice through a child's misery for the 
                common good, or to remove oneself from that city towards an unknown place 
                that may seem even less imaginable to most). When building this last project, 
                I was able to deep dive more into some of the important ethical issues as a
                digital designer who will be working in the industry and reflect upon the 
                extent of sacrificing certain aspects of my own responsibilities and values 
                as a designer/person to further my career.  </p>

        <div class="process">
            <p>'Joy' was a project where I was able to showcase a part of my personal interests and hobbies
                into a work, for which I found fitting for the last build I would present. 
                Reading is one of my favourite hobbies and being able to share one of my favourite 
                short stories and utilise its narrative as a foundation to the build was a 'joy' to create. 
                I believe that for a work to be fun to develop and meaningful conceptually, by tying in a personal aspect
                of yourself into its delivery makes the entire journey in developing the project worthwhile and special.
                From a technical standpoint, it was interesting to combine a variety of different skills into Unity. 
                Through this project, I was able to combine code, illustration, and animation together to create a user 
                experience that reaches different media fields.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conceptual">
            <p> Moreover, when combining the themes of K. Le Guin's short story with developing the 
                project, I was able to deeply consider bigger ethical questions that I would have to 
                consider when moving towards a future in the design industry. I hope that instead of 
                asking myself how far would I/how might I sacrifice the truth when designing something
                that may not align with my personal beliefs, I would ask myself at what cost', consider 
                long term impacts of the design outcome and hold my own personal responsibilities accountable. 
                Reaching out to experienced designers who have prior experiences in these situations would also 
                be good when trying to manage both personal and corporate expectations. Designer Anne Miltenburg
                puts it nicely in that we should treat design like “an ecosystem”. Designing something will
                always stay morally in the good and the bad, like a coin, and personally I believe if somewhere
                a consequence of a design will do good to a user, and aligns personally with my beliefs, 
                I can hopefully navigate the projects I choose to do and not do.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h1>LAND AHOY!</h1>
            <p>This last build wraps up my journey for this studio. With this, I have considered a future of myself 
                as a designer who does have responsibility over what I aim to take up in my practise.
