            <p>Like many people, navigating through a variety of different creative ideas and imaginative thoughts
            when developing a body of work may be a daunting and overwhelming task. When putting my creative cap on, 
            my mind can somewhat transform into an endless and complex labyrinth that is difficult to wrap myself around
            and thoroughly consider every thought. As strengthened by the 'Oulipo', being able to apply limits and constraints
            as a creative technique, I am able to channel the effective complexity of creativity into a more focused pathway 
            for which these endless creative possibilities become more manageable and new ideas are able to form as a result.

        <div class="process">
            <p>'Rat' is my last work I created using Unity, and because of that, I decided to take a more ambitious
                route by developing a working maze-like microgame. This project progressed my skills and understanding
                of Unity and C#, where I was able to apply conditional statements to player moments in relation to collisions, 
                which I had not considered before. As a result, I was able to see a progression through each unity build I had created
                over the course of this studio, such as beginning with grey blocking in the first build, to the addition of materials/low
                poly assets in the environment in the second environment, to creating a fully-fledged mini game. Overall, from a technical
                standpoint, I have developed a clearer understanding of how coding works in Unity and interactive environments.
                 </p>

        <div class="conceptual">
            <p> The concept of the 'Oulipo' for which I have personally defined as managing endless creative possibilities 
                through applying limits and constraints, I am able to welcome constraints in my practises to 
                provide focus and a pathway towards the overwhelming, infinite, and expansive world we call 'creativity' 
                into a direction where my execution is more clear cut. This is not to say that our creative thoughts should be 
                limited or restricted. Instead, I will aim to have an imagination that is endless and freeing, but employ limitations 
                in my practise as a strength to connect ideas from a variety of different sources to in turn, generate something new. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h1>Just keep swimming.</h1>
            <p>I learnt some key skills in this build to BUILD a solid foundation 
                both creatively and practically where I can navigate with ease.</p>
