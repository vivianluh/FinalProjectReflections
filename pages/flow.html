            <p>An interactive 2D build that aims to capture and display the celebration of life through 
                its constant ability to begin from nothingness, grow from nothingness, and end with nothingness </p>

            <p>The celebration of all parts of life, including that of the past, present, and the unknown 
                future, and even if parts are or become damaged and broken lends itself to a kind of journey built 
                upon a more exciting, memorable, and most importantly, genuine and authentic progression in life. By surrendering 
                to this unknown flow of life, I formed a new perspective on how I should approach and tackle my own 
                journey both from a practical and personal view.  </p>

        <div class="process">
            <p>'Flow' was a project that had affected me both as a designer and as a person. 
                As a designer, it was one of the first projects where I decided to allow myself 
                the opportunity to try something new and different. When developing the idea for 'Flow', 
                I decided to create it utilising only JavaScript in p5js. As a result, I was able to 
                understand key concepts needed to apply to all code written in Javascript (such as variables, 
                functions, classes, iteration, and arrays) and established a stronger understanding of 
                coding structures in general. Moreover, this was a big leap in a different direction 
                as my only coding experience had been only through HTML, CSS, and C# coding from the very beginning of 
                the course and this choice, albeit overwhelming, opened new avenues in my abilities within 
                the digital media scope.   </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conceptual">
            <p> Although every day is a work in progress, the concept of wabi-sabi has allowed 
                me to channel the thought of accepting the imperfect into existence, instead of 
                constantly lingering in the state of thinking I have failed. In some sense, I 
                lead a life that is confined to a strict routine, where everything is to be planned 
                out in advance to risk the confrontation of criticism or mistakes, for which my 
                lifestyle finds difficult to receive and accept. In the most colloquial way possible, 
                I have a habit of being disappointed with myself and this constant fear of failure makes 
                it difficult to practise mindfulness and accept flaws. Personally, Powell's simple quote 
                hits home with the idea that nothing is perfect, finished, or lasts, for which I view it
                 as how instead of always having to be right, choose to be kind. Kind in the sense that 
                 new opportunities will arise amidst mistakes, kind to practise mindfulness, and kind to 
                 embrace imperfection, because perfection itself is impossible. Most importantly, to 
                 be kind to myself too, to give myself time and space to grow at my own comfortable 
                 pace and celebrate the way things are unfolding, as supposed to constantly wanting 
                 to carve out a life of 'what should be'.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h1>We are floating closer to shore.</h1>
            <p>This build allowed me to dig deeper both as a designer and as a person.</p>
