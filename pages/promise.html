            <p> A 2D interactive build that aims to capture how the promise of the digital 
                being limitless is undermined by the materiality of the physical world.  </p>

            <p>Much of the digital world is advertised as an 'ethereal realm [Gonzalez] 
                that promises to be limitless, expansive, and endless, when it is very much 
                the opposite. On reflection, instead of focusing on this particular aspect 
                of the digital, I took this elusive advertised promise of the digital to 
                reflect on myself as a designer going towards a future in this industry, 
                who rather than focusing on continuing this narrative, has the opportunity 
                to utilise the concept of limited aesthetics when designing to allow all users of all 
                abilities easier navigation and access to various forms of media. </p>

        <div class="process">
            <p> 'Promise' was the second build where I decided to continue utilising JavaScript 
                as the main technical component. Another JavaScript concept was introduced and 
                employed heavily into this project, in the form of conditional logic which allowed 
                for the circle to follow the mouse's position while its movement was confined to an 
                invisible box. Conditional logic is key to user interactivity, allowing myself to give 
                or take away a user's power to manipulate or engage with a variety of different 
                elements on the screen.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conceptual">
            <p> The concept of 'limits and constraints' introduced the idea of how our digital world 
                is described as attractive due to it being advertised as having endless content and 
                opportunities despite being anything but because of its constraint of materiality. 
                As I view this dilemma, I am able to understand the certain attractiveness in knowing 
                we have a finite amount of content. In my practise, I want to design works where users 
                have to make choices and decisions when consuming or interacting media as supposed to 
                being stuck in the habit of blindly navigating through a never-ending pit of media. 
                In some sense, confidently showcasing limited aesthetics and utilising limited media 
                techniques also provides a space for users to confidently use platforms - such as how 
                Netflix isolated top 10 list gives me an idea of what I should consider watching as 
                supposed to having to scroll forever (for which I would have finished eating my dinner 
                before choosing a movie to watch). There is something liberating in truthfully recognising 
                limits in our design practises, which in turn allows myself and others to navigate more 
                efficiently through something too.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h1>I think I can see land.</h1>
            <p>With this build, I am able to recognise how employing limits invites efficiency to my practise.</p>
