            <h1>"LAWN"</h1>
            <p>an environment build that showcases the independent expression of lawn care to 
                symbolise the importance of having a presence of a void between units to allow for self-expression. </p>

            <h1>"Without space, an individual would [even] have a difficult time knowing when they should stop mowing the lawn!"</h1>

            <p>Even if it is as domestic as how an individual takes care of a patch of grass, 
                this depicts the very essence of how the presence of a void between ourselves and others 
                establishes a space for emotional clarity, personal contemplation, and reflection on oneself, 
                forming a place where everyone's personal needs, wishes, ambitions, goals, and 
                imaginations can harmoniously live side by side, together. Being able to truly enjoy a career in the design 
                industry, it is important to give myself space to grow independtly and consider my own thoughts as a designer 
                while also simultaneously navigating through a variety of different abundant design spaces. I need to remember that 
                my own needs are equally as important as someone else's needs and giving space both physically and mentally will 
                ensure these individual thoughts are met.  </p>

        <div class="process">
            <p> From a technical standpoint, I was able to further my skills in Unity by exploring a new
                and different player interaction mode by employing Nav Mesh Components. By utilising Nav Mesh
                Components, I came to understand how the implementation of a particular player view/perspective, whether 
                that be first-person, or third-person player movements (just to name a few), directly effects the way 
                a user interacts with, understands, and as a result, connects with a certain work. Employing a certain player
                perspective is not just a physical representation of the game but also a psychological representation 
                of how we should emotionally connect with it. For example, 'Lawn' utilises a isometric perspective where a player's 
                movement is in third-person as I want users to view every single element of the layout from above to strongly express
                'ma' through the concept of lawn care. These considerations are important in my practise when considering how I wish
                for the user to view, interact, and emotionally connect with a work. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conceptual">
            <p>
                The concept of 'ma' for which I have come to summarise as 
                an expanse (time and space) present between individual to allow for individual growth 
                and progress, I am able to apply this into my practise in a practical way by developing 
                a build in progressive stages as supposed to all at once. Not only is the whole development of a 
                project not as overwhelming, but I am able to establish a clear pathway when it comes to planning the 
                steps it takes to finish a work. Through this, my design process has been split up into stages that progress 
                from each other, consisting of; Research - Generation of Ideas - Development of Concepts - Refinement and Feedback.
                

                From a personal standpoint, I aim to take the meaning of 'ma' both literally and metaphorically to combat both
                my personal design needs and a design industry that is constantly changing and evolving over time. 
                By giving myself space to reflect and set time to cater for my personal endevours that are seperate to work, 
                I will be able to balance my work life and personal interests and allow them to healthily coexist together.
