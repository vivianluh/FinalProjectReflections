                Earth into its most basic entity, a spherical object.</p>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p>By denying any form of emotional and narrative expression when going about this
                particular work of presenting our Earth as anything but complex, I am 
                able to heavily consider the importance of freeing myself from a collective group's
                perception of a work. Instead, this gives rise to the opportunity to
                explore my own interpretation and individual thought of what a particular work 
                means to me. In some sense, the lack of detail allows myself, through my own
                imagination, to fill in the details mentally and thus establish a more meaningful
                connection between the work and myself, something I wish to practise when unpacking the world of design.</p>

        <div class="process">
            <p>The process of employing the techniques identified in minimalist artistic 
                practises began with the implementation of grey boxing to push back on any 
                sought of representation. In terms of effecting my practise, the strict removal of 
                detail to establish only basic primitives when developing a concept allowed myself to 
                greatly observe the work. Taking time for observation effected the way I interactived with 
                the work as a whole, taking in a variety of different aspects I wouldn't normally consider
                in a great amount; such as the way light and shadows work in relation to the object, and even 
                the way I myself interacted with it and the senses I utilised while viewing the work. Due to this,
                the meaning of what the work means to me had also evolved. 
                
                A work should be equally as powerful with and without detail, as its strength equally lies 
                in the many avenues of what encompasses a work; whether that be light, shadow, and our
                interactions. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conceptual">
            <p>In a way, the concept of minimalism for which I have come 
                to learn as a way to strip down the various exclusivities we inject into our community, 
                I am able to understand how as a creator who will hold responsibility in the digital media
                industry as I move closer towards that second stage in my practise, 
                I want to present content that allows each individual to develop their own interpretations 
                of how it effects them and what it means to them as supposed to a piece of work that is 
                confined to only having one right exposition. This goal towards creating works 
                that offer user interactivity universal of all ages and abilities, I can form an engaging
                environment where many people are able to experience and have access to digital media works, and be 
            a part of that process moving towards a more digitalised future. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h1>One small step (towards shore)</h1>
            <p>For me, this build was just a taster,
                keeping at its most minimal and simplistic in terms of conceptualisation and skillset.</p>
